Algorithm
----------
- An algorithm is a precise step-by-step procedure that
solves a problem or achieves a goal.
Don't write any code for an algorithm in a method 
until the steps are completely clear to you.

----------
Precondition
----------
- The precondition for any piece of code, whether it is a method,
loop, or block, is a statement of what is true immediately before
execution of that code.

----------
Postcondition
----------
- The postcondition for a piece of code is a statement of what is true
immediately after execution of that code.
