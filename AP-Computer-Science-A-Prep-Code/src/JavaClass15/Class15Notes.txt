Static Methods vs Instance Methods

The methods discussed earlier -- constructors, accessors,
and mutators -- all operate on individual objects of 
a class. They are called instance methods.

--------------------

An instance method is invoked ina  client program by 
using an object variable followed by the dot operator 
followed by the method name:

BankAccount b = new BankAccount();
b.desposit(acctPassword, amount);

A static method, by contrast, is invoked by using the
class name with the dot operator. There is no need to
create objects in order to access static methods or
variables.

double interestRate = BankAccount.getInterestRate();
