Q1. Here is a program segment to find the quantity baseexp. Both base and exp are entered at the keyboard.
System.out.println("Enter base and exponent: ");
double base = IO.readDouble(); //read user input
double exp = IO.readDouble(); //read user input
/* code to find power, which equals baseexp */
System.out.print(base + " raised to the power " + exp);
System.out.println(" equals " + power);
Which is a correct replacement for
/* code to find power, which equals baseexp */?
I double power;
Math m = new Math();
power = m.pow(base, exp);
II double power;
power = Math.pow(base, exp);
III int power;
power = Math.pow(base, exp);
(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) I and II only
(E) I and III only


ANSWER: B


Q2:
Here are some examples of negative numbers rounded to the nearest integer.
Refer to the declaration
double d = -4.67;
Which of the following correctly rounds d to the nearest integer?
(A) int rounded = Math.abs(d);
(B) int rounded = (int) (Math.random() * d);
(C) int rounded = (int) (d - 0.5);
(D) int rounded = (int) (d + 0.5);
(E) int rounded = Math.abs((int) (d - 0.5));
