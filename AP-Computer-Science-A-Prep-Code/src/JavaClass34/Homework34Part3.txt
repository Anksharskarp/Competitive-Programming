a)Consider these three tasks:

I A sequential search of an array of n names
II A binary search of an array of n names in alphabetical order
III An insertion sort into alphabetical order of an array of n names that are initially in random
order
For large n, which of the following lists these tasks in order (from least to greatest) of their
average case run times?
(A) II I III
(B) I II III
(C) II III I
(D) III I II
(E) III II I

Answer: A


b) Consider the following method:
/** Precondition: a[0],a[1]...a[n-1] contain integers. */
public static int someMethod(int[] a, int n, int value)
{
if (n == 0)
return -1;
else
{
if (a[n-1] == value)
return n - 1;
else
return someMethod(a, n - 1, value);
}
}
The method shown is an example of
(A) insertion sort.
(B) mergesort.
(C) selection sort.
(D) binary search.
(E) sequential search.

Answer: E
