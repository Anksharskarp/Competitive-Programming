Recursion
----------
- A recursive method is a method that calls itself.

----------
General Form of Recursive Functions
----------
- Every recursive method has two distinct parts:
    - A base case or termination condition that causes the method
      to end.
    - A nonbase case whose actions move the algorithm towards the base
      case and termination.

----------
A word of warning...
----------
- Make sure your recursive function has a termination condition; otherwise, 
  you could end up dealing with an infinite loop!

----------
An interesting example
----------
- Below is an example of a recursive function:


public class WordPlay {

  public static void stackWords() {
    String word = IO.readString();
    if (word.equals("."))
      System.out.println();
    else 
      stackWords();
    
    system.out.println(word)
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Enter list of words, one per line.");
    System.out.println("Final word should be a period (.));
    stackWords();
  }
}
