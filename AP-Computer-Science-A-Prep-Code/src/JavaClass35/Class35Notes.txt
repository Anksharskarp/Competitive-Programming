What does a Binary Search Do?
----------
- It simply uses a divide and conquer approach (only good for presorted data). It returns the position of the key that
are looking for in the list. Here is its workflow:

    1. It checks the middle term. If the value you are searching for is it, great! Otherwise,
    depending on whether the key you are looking for is greater or lower than the middle value, it proceeds
    to the right or left, readjusting the "middle" value.

    2. It continues this way, further narrowing the scope of the search.

    3. It eventually finds the key (super duper efficient, has a complexity of only O(log n)).
