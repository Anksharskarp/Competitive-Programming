Part 2: Multiple Choice Questions:
1. Refer to method search.
/** @param v an initialized array of integers
* @param key the value to be found
* Postcondition:
* - Returned value k is such that -1 <= k <= v.length-1.
* - If k >= 0 then v[k] == key.
* - If k == -1, then key != any of the elements in v.
*/
public static int search(int[] v, int key)
{
int index = 0;
while (index < v.length && v[index] < key)
index++;
if (v[index] == key)
return index;
else
return -1;
}
Assuming that the method works as intended, which of the following should be
added to the precondition of search?
(A) v is sorted smallest to largest.
(B) v is sorted largest to smallest.
(C) v is unsorted.
(D) There is at least one occurrence of key in v.
(E) key occurs no more than once in v.

Answer: A


2. The following code is designed to set index to the location of the first occurrence of key in array a and
to set index to âˆ’1 if key is not in a.
index = 0;
while (a[index] != key)
index++;
if (a[index] != key)
index = -1;
which case will this program definitely fail to perform the task described?
(A) When key is the first element of the array
(B) When key is the last element of the array
(C) When key is not in the array
(D) When key equals 0
(E) When key equals a[key]

Answer: C



3) Consider the following method:
public static void sketch(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int n)
{
if (n <= 0)
drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2);
else
{
int xm = (x1 + x2 + y1 - y2) / 2;
int ym = (y1 + y2 + x2 - x1) / 2;
sketch(x1, y1, xm, ym, n - 1);
sketch(xm, ym, x2, y2, n - 1);
}
}
Assume that the screen looks like aCartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center, and
that drawLine connects (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Which picture best represents the sketch drawn by
the method call sketch(a, 0, -a, 0, 2). where a is a positive integer?

Answer: B
