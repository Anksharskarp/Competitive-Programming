Sorting Algorithms
----------
- There are three sorting algorithms that you need to know for the AP Computer
Science A exam:
    - Selection Sort (important)
    - Insertion Sort (important)
    - Merge Sort (important)
    - Binary Search
    - Quick Sort (optional, not in the curriculum)
    - Bubble Sort (optional, not in the curriculum)

- You need to understand how each of the sorting algorithms work.

Selection Sort
----------
- This is a search-and-swap algorithm, and remember that the selection sort searches
and swaps. It always looks for the smallest element.

- The sort will first span the array for the lowest value. Once it finds the lowest
value, it will swap its position in the array with the data at index 0.

- Now the first element is sorted. The process then repeats for index 1. The rest of
the array will be searched for the lowest value and swapped with the data at index 1.

Insertion Sort
