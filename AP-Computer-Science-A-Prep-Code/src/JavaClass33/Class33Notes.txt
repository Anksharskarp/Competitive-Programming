Sorting Algorithms (AP Computer Science A)
----------
- For the AP Computer Science A course, you need to know the following sorting algorithms:
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort

----------
Selection Sort
----------
- This is a search-and-swap algorithm, and remember that the selection sort searches
and swaps. It always looks for the smallest element.

- The sort will first span the array for the lowest value. Once it finds the lowest
value, it will swap its position in the array with the data at index 0.

- Now the first element is sorted. The process then repeats for index 1. The rest of
the array will be searched for the lowest value and swapped with the data at index 1.


----------
Insertion Sort
----------
- It compares the first two elements and if the 2nd element is less than the 1st element,
inserts the second value "in front" of the first value into index 0, moving the first value
to index 1. the first two elements are now sorted.

- Then, the third element is checked. It is inserted into its correct position.
