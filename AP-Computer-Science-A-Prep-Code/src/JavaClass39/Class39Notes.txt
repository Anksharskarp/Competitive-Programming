--------------------
For each vs. For
----------
- Use a for-each loop whenever you need access to every element in an array without replacing
  or removing any elements.

- Use a for loop in all other cases: to access the index of any element, to replace or remove
elements, or to access just some of the elements.

- Do not use a for-each loop to remove or replace elements of an array.

- Note that if you have an array of objects (not primitive types), you can use the for-each
  loop and mutator methods of the object to modify the fields of any instance.
