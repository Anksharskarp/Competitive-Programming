An Important Note
----------
- The presentation for your final project in this class will be on April 27th.
  Please have your presentation ready beforehand, and your project COMPLETED by that
  deadline.

----------
Arrays
----------
Initialization:
- In Java, an array is an object; therefore, the keyword 'new' must be used in its creation.
  The size of an array remains fixed once it has been created. As with String objects,
  however, an array reference may be reassigned to a new array of a different size.

- If you reinitialize another array with the same name as a previous one, then the memory
  allocated for the previous data array is recycled by Java's automatic garbage collection
  system.



----------
ArrayLists
----------
- An ArrayList provides an alternative way of storing a list of objects and has the following advantages over an array:
    - An ArrayList shrinks and grows as needed in a program, whereas an array has a fixed length
      that is set when the array is created.

    - In an ArrayList list, the last slot is always list.size() - 1, whereas in a partially filled
      array, you, the programmer, must keep track of the last slot currently in use.

    - For an ArrayList, you can do insertion or deletion with just a single statement. Any shifting
      of elements is handled automatically. In an array, however, insertion or deletion requires you
      to write the code that shifts the elements.
