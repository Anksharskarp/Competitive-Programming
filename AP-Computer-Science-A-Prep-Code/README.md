## Introduction

Welcome to my code snippets and samples from the EasyFunCoding Advanced I class! 
These files were created from 2020 to 2021, and are continued to be maintained. 
Feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any suggestions. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be 
found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Troubleshooting (Visual Studio Code)

If you encounter a `Failed to Load Main Class` or `Main Class Not Found` error,
simply restart the Java Language Workspace by pressing `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` and 
selecting `Restart and Delete Java Language Workspace.` 
Otherwise, try updating the Project Manager for Java in Visual Studio Code. 

**Note: Once you rebuild the project, make sure you add in the `package` keyword, 
which has important information about the folder in which the `.java` code file resides.

## Troubleshooting (IntelliJ IDEA)

In the event of any issues, the tried and true method is going to the `File` 
dropdown menu, selecting `Invalidate Caches / Restart`
and wait for the IDE to reboot and add the `.idea` settings folder to the project 
(a common issues across different platforms).
