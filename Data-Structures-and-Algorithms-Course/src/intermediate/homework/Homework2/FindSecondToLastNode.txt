//Algorithm to Find Second-to-Last Node in a Linked List where the the last node is indicated by a null next reference.

if(size==0 || size==1) {
    // no second to last node
}

Node runner = this.head;
while(runner.getNext().getNext() != null) {
    runner = runner.getNext();
}
// Now runner points to the node that points to the null node
// (i.e., runner points to the second-to-last node.)
