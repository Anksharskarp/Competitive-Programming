Cloning data structures using the deep copy method for primitive data structures, like arrays, only creates a shallow
copy when you're dealing with data structures containing objects.

For example, if the variable contacts refers to an array of hypothetical Person instances, the result of the command:

guests = contacts.clone()

produces a shallow copy.

A deep copy of the contact list can be created by iteratively cloning the individual elements, as follows, but only if
the Person class is declared as Cloneable.
Here, in this example, guests is a deep copy being made of the original data structure (containing objects), contacts.

Person[] guests = new Person[contacts.length];
for(int k = 0; k < contacts.length; k++) {
    guests[k] = (Person) contacts[k].clone();
}
