Homework #1:

- Array related assignment (due two weeks later):
  - Write your own CaesarCiper class, implement its encryption and decryption methods, and test your encryption and decryption for a random input english sentence (you need to skip all punctuations).
  - We discussed substitution cipher, please write a SUB_CIPHER class with one encoder array of 26 letters, one constructior with a parameter char array, and two methods (encryption and decryption), and then a main method containing testing code. Using your implementation to encrypt and decrypt the following respectively: (1) plaintext: cryptography. (2) ciphertext: MGZVYZLGHCMHJMYXSSFMNHAHYCDLMHA . Assume the given encoder array: X| N| Y| A| H| P| O| G| Z|Q| W|B| T | S | F| L| R| C |V|M|U |E | K | J | D | I
  - (Optional) if you have time and are interested in games, please write your first game program for game Tic-Tac-Toe using two dimensional array and random number generator. You are one player and computer (part of your code) is another player.
  - Do those array related problems from easy to midium, even to hard, please send me the problem numbers and the execution results for any problem(s) you will have finished.
- Linked List Assignment:
  - Write and implement your own single linked list class.
    Notes: This is by default. Similarly, for all data structures we will learn in the rest of the class, implement your own classes.
  - Give an algorithm for finding the second-to-last node in a singly linked list in which the last node is indicated by a null next reference.
    Do those Linked List related problems from easy to medium, even to hard, please send me the problem numbers and the execution results for any problem(s) you will have finished.
