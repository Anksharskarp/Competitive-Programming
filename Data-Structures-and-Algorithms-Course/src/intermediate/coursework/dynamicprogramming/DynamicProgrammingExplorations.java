Dynamic programming Algorithms:
In dynamic programming, a large and complicated problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems in a recursive manner
until the smallest problem size is reached. From there on out, the solutions are combined in an upward manner to get
a more sophisticated solution until at the root of the "solution tree," the final solution is obtained by the algorithm.

    An implementation of a Matrix-chain Multiplication Algorithm using the foundational principles of dynamic
    programming. Here, we are trying to multiply multiple matrices together, using the standard mathematical method
    of chaining rows (1st matrix in the matrix multiplication process) and columns (2nd matrix in the matrix
    multiplication process) together for their elements to be multiplied together one by one, then summed together
    to give the final product of multiplying the singular row and column together, which is then added to the product
    matrix as an element.
